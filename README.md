## Communication Socket
It's an IRC client with no features but one day I will add all the cool features

## Compiling and running
to compile you run `qmake`<br>
and then you run `make`<br>
now you have a binary you can run yay!!
(this is for compiling on linux and stuff, i don't know how to compile to windows sorry)
